What specific areas of the car have been affected?,https://res.cloudinary.com/alexlimclarify/image/upload/v1737185571/Img/4_240.jpg,"The image shows a close-up of a car's body panel, specifically around the wheel arch area. There is noticeable damage labeled as a ""scratch."" The scratch is quite extensive, with the paint visibly scraped off, exposing the underlying material. The damage appears to have affected a significant portion of the panel, with some areas showing deeper gouges and others lighter abrasions. The car's paint color is a light metallic shade, possibly silver or gray. The tire and part of the wheel well are visible at the bottom right of the image."
